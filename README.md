# SBA307

For this Skills Based Assesment, I completed the following requirements: 

HTML Requirements
Have at least three pages. - We have 4 pages including "Home", "Clients", "Services" and "Sign up"
Keep the grid system consistent between pages as much as possible. - I've used the same navBar for every page and duplicated some of the content containers tu mantain a consistent grid
Use at least ten different HTML tags. - Just in the homepage I used: "html", "head", "meta", "link", "title", "script", "body", "header", "nav", "a", "img", "div", "main", "h1", "p", "strong" and "button" 
Include at least one table. - The service page includes a table with a header, 3 columns and 4 rows.
Include at least two forms. - ****
Include at least one dropdown menu. - The sign in nav link is actually a dropdown menu with the options to login as a client or as an admin

Include at least one of each of the following forms of content: 
Text. - checked
Images. - checked
GIFs. - checked
(See resource links above for some free content of each of these types.)

CSS Requirements
Make use of inline, internal, and external styling. - Each page has the external styling link, the pages that have img tags have inline styling for those elements and in the Service page I used internal styling to overwrite the bootstrap styling I linked. 
Use five different CSS selectors. - I used element selectors for general styling (*, body, li, a), most of the selectors I used were .class but also I used #id to select one element inside the nav, and I also used the pseudo-class :hover to make some animations.
Use colors that complement each other. - the color palette used was "https://coolors.co/palette/d17d10-ef9826-f5c07a-8ebc38-afd36b-d4e8b0" that remind me of a park, earthy tones.
Coolors is one of many resources that can help you find a color palette.
Use Flexbox and/or the Bootstrap Grid. - I used Flexbox as my main positioning tool but I also used Bootstrap to generate the table in Services page.
Use at least two CSS animations. - There's one surprise animation in the homepage and the whole navbar has animations on hover
